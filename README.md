# What is the quality of evidence informing vaccine policy in Australia?

## Outline

This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate the analysis for the Dymock et. al. manuscript entitled *What is the quality of evidence informing vaccine policy recommendations in Australia?*.

## Details

The raw data (obtained from the references listed in the manuscript) was collated and stored in a series of R scripts (one for each respective disease area). The scripts are stored in the [R Scripts](./R%20Scripts) folder.

The analysis is contained in an R script entitled *GRADE Analysis.R* and is also located within the [R Scripts](./R%20Scripts) folder. Note that the analyses are purely descriptive. This file contains the code to replicate the data summaries and figures.

Before running the analysis script please ensure that the data scripts have been downloaded and saved into the same working directory.
